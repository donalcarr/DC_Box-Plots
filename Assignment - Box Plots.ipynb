    "John Tukey introduced the box and whiskers plot as part of his toolkit for exploratory data analysis. Over 40 years later, the boxplot has become one of the most frequently used tools for data visualisation\n",
    "and is one of the few plot types invented in the 20th century that has found widespread adoption.\n",
    "\n",
    "The box plot was originally designed to be computated and drawn by hand. The basic graphic form of the boxplot, the range-bar, was established in the early 1950’s by M. E. Spear in the book Charting Statistics.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "A boxplot is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on a five number summary (“minimum”, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and “maximum”). It can tell you about your outliers and what their values are. It can also tell you if your data is symmetrical, how tightly your data is grouped, and if and how your data is skewed.[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "John Tukey has provided a precise definition for two types of outliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Outliers are either 3×IQR or more above the third quartile or 3×IQR or more below the first quartile.\n",
    "Suspected outliers are are slightly more central versions of outliers: either 1.5×IQR or more above the third quartile or 1.5×IQR or more below the first quartile.\n",
    "If either type of outlier is present the whisker on the appropriate side is taken to 1.5×IQR from the quartile (the \"inner fence\") rather than the max or min, and individual outlying data points are displayed as unfilled circles (for suspected outliers) or filled circles (for outliers). (The \"outer fence\" is 3×IQR from the quartile.)\" [3]\n",
